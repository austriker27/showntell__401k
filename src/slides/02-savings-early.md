## Ellie vs Larry

- Early Ellie diligently invests $100 a month for ten years. She stops contributing when she turns 30 but leaves the money in the market for the next thirty years until she's 60.
- Late Larry waits ten years before he starts investing $100 a month into the stock market for the next thirty years until he is also 60.
